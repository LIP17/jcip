/**
 * When using condition waits (Object.wait or Condition.await):
 *      1. Always have a condition predicateâ€”some test of object state that must hold before proceeding;
 *      2. Always test the condition predicate before calling wait, and again after returning from wait;
 *      3. Always call wait in a loop;
 *      4. Ensure that the state variables making up the condition predicate are guarded by the lock associated with the condition queue;
 *      5. Hold the lock associated with the the condition queue when calling wait, notify, or notifyAll; and
 *      6. Do not release the lock after checking the condition predicate but before acting on it.
